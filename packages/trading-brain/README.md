**Adaptive Trading Intelligence & Signal Learning System for Claude Code**

Trading Brain is an MCP server that gives Claude Code a persistent trading memory. It learns from every trade outcome — strengthening connections between signals, strategies, and results through a Hebbian synapse network. Over time, it develops confidence in signal combinations, adapts calibration parameters, and surfaces research insights about your trading patterns.

## Why Trading Brain?

Without Trading Brain, every trading decision starts from zero. With Trading Brain:

- **Signals are weighted by experience** — Brain tracks which signal combinations actually lead to winning trades, not just theory
- **Confidence is statistical** — Wilson Score intervals provide conservative confidence bounds, not just raw win rates
- **DCA multipliers adapt** — Brain-recommended position sizes adjust based on regime awareness and historical performance
- **Grid parameters tune themselves** — Volatility-aware grid spacing multipliers based on actual outcomes
- **Patterns emerge automatically** — The learning engine extracts rules from signal fingerprint groupings
- **Streaks are detected** — Chain detection identifies winning and losing streaks per pair
- **Knowledge compounds** — Every trade outcome makes Brain smarter through Hebbian learning
- **Research runs continuously** — Trend analysis, gap detection, synergy mapping, and regime shift detection

## Features

### Core Intelligence
- **Trade Outcome Memory** — Record and query trade outcomes with full signal context
- **Signal Fingerprinting** — RSI, MACD, Trend, and Volatility classification into discrete categories
- **Wilson Score Confidence** — Statistical confidence intervals with adaptive z-scores based on data volume
- **Hebbian Synapse Network** — Weighted graph connecting signals, combos, outcomes, pairs, and regimes
- **Spreading Activation** — Explore related knowledge by activating nodes in the synapse network
- **Adaptive Calibration** — Learning rate, Wilson z-score, and decay half-life auto-calibrate across 4 stages

### Learning Engine
- **Pattern Extraction** — Fingerprint grouping with similarity threshold → rules when confidence exceeds gate
- **Chain Detection** — Identifies 3+ consecutive same-result trades on the same pair
- **Temporal Decay** — Exponential half-life decay keeps recent trades more relevant
- **Recalibration** — Auto-recalibrates every 25 trades based on data volume and synapse density

### Dream Mode (new in v2.10)
- **Offline Consolidation** — Memory replay, synapse pruning, memory compression, importance decay during idle periods
- **Idle Detection** — Automatically triggers when brain is idle for 5+ minutes
- **Manual Trigger** — Force a dream cycle via MCP tool or IPC

### Research Engine
- **Trend Detection** — Identifies pairs with consistently improving or declining win rates
- **Gap Detection** — Finds signal combinations with few data points that need more testing
- **Synergy Detection** — Discovers which signal pairs frequently co-occur in winning trades
- **Performance Analysis** — Ranks pairs and strategies by statistical confidence
- **Regime Shift Detection** — Alerts when a pair's recent performance deviates from its baseline

### Never Forget — Memory & Sessions
- **Persistent Memory** — Store preferences, decisions, context, facts, goals, and lessons learned
- **Key-Based Upsert** — Update existing memories by unique key, auto-superseding old values
- **Full-Text Search** — Natural language recall with FTS5-powered search
- **Session Tracking** — Track conversation goals, summaries, and outcomes
- **Importance Scoring** — 1–10 importance scale with category-based organization
- **Soft Deletes** — Deactivate memories without losing history

### Strategy Recommendations
- **DCA Multiplier** — Brain-recommended multiplier (0.3x–2.5x) based on regime and RSI context
- **Grid Parameters** — Volatility-aware grid spacing with historical performance adjustment

### Universal Access
- **MCP Server** — Stdio transport for Claude Code integration
- **MCP HTTP/SSE** — Standard MCP protocol over HTTP for Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Continue
- **REST API** — Full HTTP API on port 7779 with RPC endpoint

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @timmeck/trading-brain
trading setup
```

That's it. One command configures MCP and starts the daemon.

Or install globally and configure manually:

```bash
npm install -g @timmeck/trading-brain
```

### Setup with Claude Code

Add Trading Brain's MCP server to your Claude Code configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "trading-brain": {
      "command": "trading",
      "args": ["mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Setup with Cursor / Windsurf / Cline / Continue

Trading Brain supports MCP over HTTP with SSE transport:

```json
{
  "trading-brain": {
    "url": "http://localhost:7780/sse"
  }
}
```

Make sure the daemon is running (`trading start`).

### Start the Daemon

```bash
trading start
trading status
trading doctor    # verify everything is configured correctly
```

The daemon runs background tasks: learning cycles, research analysis, synapse decay, and recalibration.

## How It Learns

1. **Trade Outcome Recorded** — A bot completes a trade and reports the result via `trading_record_outcome`
2. **Signal Fingerprinted** — RSI, MACD, Trend, and Volatility are classified into discrete categories
3. **Synapses Form** — Hebbian connections link signal → combo → outcome → pair. Winners strengthen, losers weaken
4. **Graph Updated** — Nodes and edges are created/strengthened in the weighted graph
5. **Chain Checked** — If 3+ consecutive same-result trades on a pair, a chain is recorded
6. **Confidence Computed** — Wilson Score provides statistical lower bound on true win rate
7. **Patterns Extracted** — Similar fingerprints are grouped; rules generated when confidence exceeds threshold
8. **Calibration Adapts** — Every 25 trades, learning rate, Wilson z, and decay half-life recalibrate
9. **Research Runs** — Background analysis finds trends, gaps, synergies, and regime shifts
10. **Next Trade** — Signal weights, DCA multiplier, and grid params incorporate all learned knowledge

## Algorithms

### Wilson Score Confidence
Conservative statistical confidence interval for win rates. Adaptive z-score: starts at 1.0 (few trades) → reaches 1.96 (500+ trades).

### Hebbian Learning
"Signals that win together wire together." Asymmetric updates:
- **Strengthen** (win): `weight += (1 - weight) * learningRate` (asymptotic approach to 1.0)
- **Weaken** (loss): `weight *= penalty` (multiplicative decay)

### Spreading Activation
BFS-based energy propagation through the weighted graph. Decay factor 0.6, threshold 0.05, max depth 4. Used for signal weight bonuses and network exploration.

### Adaptive Calibration
4 stages based on trade count:
| Stage | Trades | Learning Rate | Wilson Z | Decay Half-Life |
|-------|--------|--------------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | <20 | 0.3 | 1.0 | 60 days |
| 2 | 20–100 | 0.15 | 1.44 | 45 days |
| 3 | 100–500 | 0.08 | 1.65 | 30 days |
| 4 | >500 | 0.05 | 1.96 | 21 days |

### Signal Fingerprinting
Each signal dimension is classified:
- **RSI**: oversold (<30), neutral (30–70), overbought (>70)
- **MACD**: strong_bull (>0.5), bull (>0), bear (<0), strong_bear (<-0.5)
- **Trend**: strong_up (>0.5), up (>0), down (<0), strong_down (<-0.5)
- **Volatility**: low (<0.3), medium (0.3–0.7), high (>0.7)

## Brain Ecosystem

Trading Brain is part of the **[Brain Ecosystem](https://github.com/timmeck/brain-ecosystem)** — a monorepo of MCP servers that give Claude Code persistent, self-learning memory.

| Brain | Purpose | Ports |
|-------|---------|-------|
| [Brain](https://github.com/timmeck/brain-ecosystem/tree/main/packages/brain) v3.10.0 | Error memory, code intelligence, persistent context & autonomous research | 7777 / 7778 |
| **Trading Brain** v2.10.0 | Adaptive trading intelligence with memory, sessions & autonomous research | **7779** / 7780 |
| [Marketing Brain](https://github.com/timmeck/brain-ecosystem/tree/main/packages/marketing-brain) v1.11.0 | Content strategy, engagement, campaigns & autonomous research | 7781 / 7782 / 7783 |
| [Brain Core](https://github.com/timmeck/brain-ecosystem/tree/main/packages/brain-core) v2.9.0 | Shared infrastructure (IPC, MCP, REST, CLI, math, synapses, memory, research) | — |
| [Brain Hub](https://timmeck.github.io/brain-hub/) | Ecosystem landing page | — |

All packages live in the [brain-ecosystem](https://github.com/timmeck/brain-ecosystem) monorepo with npm workspaces. [Brain Core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@timmeck/brain-core) provides shared infrastructure (IPC, MCP, REST API, CLI, math, synapse algorithms) used by all brains, eliminating ~2,800 lines of duplicated code.

### Cross-Brain Communication

Brains discover and query each other at runtime via IPC named pipes. Use `trading peers` to see online peers, or the `trading_query_peer` / `trading_ecosystem_status` MCP tools to access peer data from Claude Code. Brains push event notifications to peers — when Trading Brain records a trade outcome or calibrates signals, Brain and Marketing Brain are notified automatically.

### Ecosystem Dashboard

The interactive HTML dashboard (`trading dashboard`) includes an Ecosystem Peers section showing the live status of all connected brains.

## Support

If Trading Brain helps you, consider giving it a star — it helps others discover the project and keeps development going.
